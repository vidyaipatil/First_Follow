# First_Follow
First_Follow Java Program

Introduction

The First_Follow program is a Java-based implementation for computing the First and Follow sets of a given grammar. This program helps in constructing parsing tables for syntax analysis in compiler design.

Features

Accepts a user-defined grammar.

Computes the First and Follow sets for a given non-terminal.

Identifies terminals and non-terminals from user input.

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

Basic understanding of compiler design concepts.

How to Run the Program

Compile the Java program:

javac First_Follow.java

Run the compiled Java class:

java First_Follow

Input Format

The number of grammar rules.

Grammar rules (one per line in A -> α | β format).

Number of terminals and non-terminals.

List of terminals and non-terminals.

The non-terminal for which First and Follow sets are to be calculated.

Sample Input

Enter the number of lines in the grammar:
3
E -> TX
X -> +TX | ε
T -> FY
Enter the number of non-terminals in the grammar:
3
Enter the number of terminals in the grammar:
3
Enter the terminals one by one:
+ * ( )
Enter the non-terminals one by one:
E X T
Enter the non-terminal whose first and follow you want to calculate:
E

Sample Output

The First is:
( T  ε  +
The Follow is:
) $

Functions Overview

first(char s, List<String> gr, char[] t, char[] nt, int te, int no_t)

Recursively computes the First set of a non-terminal.

follow(char s, List<String> gr, char[] t, char[] nt, int te, int no_t)

Computes the Follow set by checking the position of the non-terminal in the grammar rules.

is_terminal(char[] x, char t)

Checks if a character is a terminal.

is_non_terminal(char[] x, char t)

Checks if a character is a non-terminal.

Notes

The program assumes the grammar is provided in a structured format.

It does not handle left recursion.

The epsilon (ε) is used to denote an empty production.
